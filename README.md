# Business-Analysis
Starting from five csv files (downloaded from a Kaggle Dataset), I try to analyze the data using Power Bi Desktop and Python. It's an attempt of choosing the right way to get an effective and useful data analysis.

I repeat almost the same operations in Power Bi and Python in order to try to get the same results through different ways. This analysis describes the most important firms in the world and their position in the overall universe of the business world. 
In Python I decided to define both bar plots and pie plots to study the relative positions of the top ten firms and countries in any financial sector. Overall, I believe this could be a good exercise of Exploration Data Analysis about business data.
